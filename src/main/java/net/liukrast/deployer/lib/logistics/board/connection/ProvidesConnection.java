    /**
     * Connections are the core process of a panel. This method is called when your panel is created and will want you to decide what the panel needs to handle.
     * When you specify an output, you will be asked to provide a {@link Supplier}. That will tell other gauges trying to read this what value this gauge is holding, in real time.
     * On the other side, specifying inputs is only used as "declaration", you declare that this gauge will eventually read that type of value, so that we know what connections you can pick in the connecting cable.
     * Order matters! In fact, when you first connect two panels, the system will automatically
     * establish a link based on the first compatible data type found in the registration order
     * of the input panel.
     * * <p>
     * If there are no shared data types between the source's outputs and the target's inputs,
     * the connection will remain inactive (no data will flow). However, if multiple data types
     * are compatible, the first one registered in the input panel's builder takes priority
     * as the default.
     * </p>
     * * <p>
     * Users can manually override this selection using a Wrench on the connection.
     * The manual selection is restricted to the intersection of available types:
     * a connection can only be established for a type that is both provided by the output
     * panel and accepted by the input panel.
     * </p>

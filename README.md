## Gauge Creation API
<table>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
      Deployer provides a comprehensive API for creating custom gauges, evolved from the Extra Gauges addon.
      Deployer handles all the hard part, making it possible for different gauges to stay in the same block!
      <br><br>
      You can handle connections coming in and coming out from the gauge, and handle everything you want!

## Extended Goggle Information
<table>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
      Create's vanilla goggle overlay system only supports block entities, limiting what information can be displayed when players look at blocks or entities. Deployer extends this functionality through the <code>DeployerGoggleInformation</code> interface, enabling goggle information display for regular blocks without block entities and for entities in the world.
      <br><br>
      It's also possible to register your own goggle information through <code>ClientRegisterHelpers</code>, under your specific conditions

<table>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
      With deployer you can create custom stock keeper and redstone requester tabs. Creating a tab is not necessarily linked to creating a stock inventory type. You can stor any data inside your tab and use it for whatever you want. We already have some ideas in mind for our mods <strong>Create: Extra Gauges</strong>!

    <td valign="top">
      On the other side, redstone requesters can also have tabs which are specifically intended to order items!

## Optimization and fix
We also include a bunch of fixes and optimizations, and we want to focus the second part of this API on that, improving some useless and expensive algorithms that create for some reason has
